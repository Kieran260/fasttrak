In order to test the effectiveness of each solution, each algorithm will be compared against
the efficiency metrics specified. The number of vehicles will remain fixed, and the number
of packages shall fill the vehicles.

• Run each algorithms 5 times with random dataset, 5 times with even dataset.
• 10 vehicles with capacities 15m3 and 1000kg.
• Each vehicle fully utilised with packages measured 0.1-0.4 m3 and 5-20 kg.
• Schedule configuration: 8-hour time window, 3 minutes per delivery.
